# Week 7  

In week 7 of the module we will continue utilise the fundamental concepts of programming with C# to implement more complex solutions.  

## Directory content  

The directory contains several individual directories each of which contain a practical exercise to help reinforce the code concepts covered this week. There is an individual  Visual Studio solution for each exercise. Each VS solution contain two projects:

- __Exercise__: contains skeleton C# code with documentation comments that describe what you should do to complete the exercise.  

- __Exercise Tests__: contains an xUnit test project which you can use to validate the correctness of your solution. For detailed instructions on how to run tests in visual studio please refer to the documentation [online](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/test/run-unit-tests-with-test-explorer).  

If you notice any issues or errors create an issue or better, still offer a solution and create a pull-request. .

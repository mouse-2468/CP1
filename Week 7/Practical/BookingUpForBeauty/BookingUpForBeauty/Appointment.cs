/*
 * In this exercise you'll be working on an appointment scheduler for a beauty salon in Letterkenny that opened on September 15th in 2012.
 * You have four tasks, which will all involve appointment dates. The dates and times will use one of the following three formats:
 * "07/25/2019 13:45:00"
 * "July 25, 2019 13:45:00"
 * "Thursday, July 25, 2019 13:45:00"
